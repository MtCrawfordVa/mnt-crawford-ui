                        <strong>Restricted Parking March 2022</strong>
                        <p>
                          In March 2022, VDOT will be restricting parking on Main Street due to a scheduled detour forcing traffic to come out from North River Rd onto S. Main Street.  The exact start date of the parking restrictions or specific affected area on Main Street is not known yet. Residents will be notified as soon as VDOT provides more information. This detour is supposed to be in place for approximately one year. If you have questions, please call (540) 421-0856 or email townofmountcrawford@gmail.com
